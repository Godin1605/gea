# Web Instructions

To run the web server you should be running a \*nix system with
[`rvm`](http://rvm.io) installed. Once `rvm` is installed run `rvm install
1.9.3-p392`. If `rvm` is set up correctly once you cd into the `web` directory
all dependencies will be downloaded and installed. Once everything is installed
you can run the development server by running `rails server` in the `web`
directory. The server and web application will be accessible through
[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
