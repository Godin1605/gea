#Database Instructions

For the time being we do not have a persistent data store. All of our dummy data
is hard-coded into the controllers.

Data can by accessed by the clients through the following REST endpoints:

* `/song/:id`
* `/album/:id`
* `/artist/:id`

The REST endpoints return JSON data structures which represent each respective
`song`, `album`, or `artist`.
